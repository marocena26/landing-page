## 📄​ Description 

If you currently don't have a cat and you are thinking about letting one into your life, this space is perfect for you. In Purrfect Match we present a **simple web, intuitive and adapted to any type of device**(mobile, tablet and PC) so you can take a look at it anytime, anywhere. Based on our **own design**, the website will allow you to know some of the many benefits of having a cat as a life companion. 

This project **employs `ngx-translate` for content internationalization**, enabling **dynamic translation** of the user interface (ES-EN). It also makes use of **Angular's reactive forms for efficient form management**, facilitating **data validation and user interaction** with the application in an intuitive and robust way.

It also uses **Jasmine and Karma for unit and integration testing**, ensuring the **quality and reliability of the code**.

## 💾 Steps to follow to use this project on your computer:

> **NOTE:** This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

**First** of all, in order to have the repository on your computer:

1. Click on the top right corner > **Fork**.
2. It will ask you to choose which GitHub user you want to fork it to. **Choose your user**.
3. **Go to github.com/your-user/name-of-project**, **clone it** and do whatever you want, you can rename the repo, change the code, redeploy it to GitHub Pages...
4. **Finally** and for everything to work properly, **you must disable GitHub Pages and re-enable** it so that GitHub generates the new URL correctly.

Once you have **done the fork**:

1. Open it in your code editor.
2. Open a terminal and **install the local dependencies** by executing in the command terminal. Here are the ones I used to start my project:

```bash
npm install or yarn
npm install or yarn add primeng
npm install or yarn add primeicons
npm install or yarn add primeflex
npm install or yarn add @ngx-translate/core @ngx-translate/http-loader 
```

The project has to be **started** every time we start programming, to do this we will execute the **command**:

```bash
npm or yarn start
```

After running `npm/yarn start` we can start editing all the files inside the src/ folder and program comfortably 💫
